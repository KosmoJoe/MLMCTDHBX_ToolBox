# MLMCTDHBX_ToolBox
This repository contains matlab functions to handle data generated from the ML-MCTDHX toolkit. Given a finished computation, i.e. a many-body wave function, this MLMCTDHBX_ToolBox is able to execute the most important analysis tasks and read in the data to matlab. Moreover, a script to create and query an sqlite database which contains the computation metadata is given. In this way, runs with particular properties can be grapped to visualize their data together. Moreover, an example file is given which indicates the usage of the MLMCTDHBX_ToolBox for the time-dependent one-body density and the natural populations.
